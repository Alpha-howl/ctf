		<h2>How to play</h2> <br> <br> <br>

		<p>
			This online CTF game supports up to four players per match. <br><br>
			There are two players in a team and once a match begins...
			<br><br>
			You must help your team reach the point total of 5 so that the match ends in your
			favour!
			<br><br>
			Whichever team reaches 5 points first wins the match.
			<br><br>
			You can move your sprite by pressing and holding down the arrow keys in the direction you wish
			to travel. The maze is looked at through a bird's eye perspective.
		</p>
		<br><br><br>
		<p>
			Points are scored when a player successfully travels to the opposition's base - which
			will be on the opposite corner to your base - picks up their flag, and drops it at 
			their base.
			<br><br>
			You pick up the enemy flag by stepping onto the coloured square. Then you drop their
			flag at your base by stepping onto your base. After this you will see your team's point
			total rising by one at the top of the screen.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			If you collide into an enemy, one of you will be eliminated!<br><br>
			When someone is eliminated, they spawn back at their base and any flag they may be carrying
			is replaced back at the flag's base.
			<br><br>
			In a collision, whoever is further from their spawn/base will be eliminated, and the other
			player will be able to continue without being respawned. 
			<br><br>
			However, if one of the colliding
			players is carrying a flag, even if they are right by their base they will still be
			eliminated.
			<br><br>
			If two flag-carriers collide, something interesting happens...
			<br><br>
			Each carrier will be carrying the other's flag.
			<br><br>
			And stepping on your own flag while carrying the enemy flag gives your team an extra point.
			<br><br>
			So the carrier moving towards the other carrier will capture the enemy flag and consequently become
			a non-carrier, allowing them to eliminate the other carrier if they continue going towards them.
